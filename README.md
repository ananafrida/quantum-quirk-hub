# QuantumQuirkHub

Welcome to QuantumQuirkHub, a cosmic playground where the laws of physics and imagination collide! ðŸš€âœ¨ Explore the wonders of the universe through an interactive 3D shape generator and particle symphony. Create celestial formations, set them in motion, and let them dance to the beat of your own cosmic rhythm.

## Features

- **Dynamic 3D Shapes:** Generate mesmerizing shapes, from spheres to toruses, each with its own quirky personality.
- **Particle Playground:** Watch as particles burst into existence, leaving trails of stardust in their wake.
- **Collision Symphony:** Experience a collision orchestra with colorful visuals and quirky sound effects.
- **Galactic Harmony Slider:** Control the speed of shapes with a slider, turning your cosmic creation into a unique celestial experience.

Join the AstroFiesta and start your journey into the whimsical world of QuantumQuirkHub! ðŸŒŒðŸŽ‰

## How to Run the Project

1. Plug the ADAFruit Playground Express board through the USB of your PC.

2. Install and open the Arduino IDE.

3. In the Arduino IDE, go to **Tools -> Board -> Arduino AVR Boards -> ADAFruit Circuit Playground**.

4. Then, go to **Tools -> Board -> Port -> COM3**. This sets the board and port.

5. Click on "Upload" to upload the sketch to the board.

6. Open the Processing code and run it. A simulation window will show up.

7. You are all set!

## Motivation Behind the Project

The inspiration for this project stemmed from a fascination with 3D shapes, particularly after encountering the Trefoil example in the Graphics section under "Examples" in Processing. The desire to explore the creative potential of dynamic shapes fueled the inception of this project.

The goal was to infuse a touch of physics reality while maintaining an element of fun. Randomly generated colors combined with various shapes contribute to the vibrant and unpredictable nature of the visual experience.

The concept was further influenced by an image of "iron cutting with a machine," (picture below) which sparked the idea of introducing dynamic sparkles when shapes collide. This collision effect adds an extra layer of visual interest and playfulness to the overall experience.

In essence, this project is a journey into the intersection of art, physics, and spontaneity, aiming to captivate and inspire through the beauty of dynamic 3D shapes and whimsical collisions.
